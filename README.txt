State Left - A website designed to help find the nearest competitive state legistlative seats. Currently a program that allows the user to print results to console. Currently in the coding phase.

How to use the example:
1) Download the Github files and MySQL. Once this is done, you will need to make a few alterations order to use the example.
2) This program requires MySQL. Download MySQL and set it up on your computer.

MySQL Download: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/
MySQL Documentation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/

3) When setting the user and password for MySQL, the default ones for the program are "sample" and "password". You can find these in sample_file/sample_keys.txt. The program uses CSV to read the keys properly. If you have set up a different login and password, simply replace "sample" and "password" with the appropriate terms. Be sure to leave the commas in place!
4) Once this is done, go into the Main class file. Under the main method, comment out all of the lines except for "createSampleDatabaseAndRunProgram();" (if this is commented out, remove the comment markers). Now you're ready to rock!
